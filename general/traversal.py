# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
# BFS

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
# BFS
# DFS (can take a long)

# If the tree is very wide:
# DFS
# BFS (too much memory. Has to keep track of nodes in a queue)

# If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
# DFS

# Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
# DFS

# Finding the shortest path:
# BFS
